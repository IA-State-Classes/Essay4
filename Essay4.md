A software developer, depending on what they want to do, has several options in terms of what library they want to use. They may want to develop a game, so they may use a library tailored to that goal. However, there are many libraries available for a type of goal. If a developer wishes to use a library to process PDF files (in python), they can choose between several libraries. Two of these libraries are PyPDF2 and pdfMiner.

PyPDF2 is a library with many different iterations, where the maintenance of this iteration was taken over by Martin Thoma in April of 2022. Furthermore, issues are found and resolved fairly regularly with this library. Currently, pyPDF2 supports python versions 3.6 - 3.10 and with previous versions of the library (PyPDF2 1.20.0 - 1.28.4) supporting python version 2.7 (along with the previously mentioned versions). With PyPDF2, a developer can merge pdf files, extract text and metadata, write to pdf files, and transform the contents of a PDF file. 

PdfMiner has two iterations, pdfMiner and pdfMiner.six. For this essay pdfMiner will reference the pdfMiner.six iteration because it is more recently maintained. Issues are found and resolved similarly to pyPDF2. Currently, this library supports python versions 3.6 or newer. With PdfMiner a developer can extract text, metadata, and images from a PDF file.
